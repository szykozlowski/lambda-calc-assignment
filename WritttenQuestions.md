### Question 3

Capture-avoiding substitution is a method used to replace a variable in a mathematical expression without changing its meaning. Imagine you have a formula with placeholders, and you want to swap one placeholder for another value. If you arenâ€™t careful, some parts of the formula might accidentally change meaning because the new value might clash with an existing one. To avoid this, the substitution is done carefully, sometimes renaming other parts, so everything stays clear and correct.
