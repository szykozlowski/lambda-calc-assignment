# Lambda Calculus Interpreter in Python

This repository is essentially a fork of [alexhkurz/lambdaC-2024](https://codeberg.org/alexhkurz/lambdaC-2024) with some minor modifications.

It will serve as our starting point to develop a small functional programming language in three milestones.

For installation etc see the original README at [alexhkurz/lambdaC-2024](https://codeberg.org/alexhkurz/lambdaC-2024/README.md).
  
The only change to the original code is that `grammar.lark`  has been modified so that comments now do not start with `--` but with `//` to accommodate "double minus" for arithmetic.

See [here](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJZJb7tekx) for details of the programming assignment 4 for the course "Programming Languages 2024".
